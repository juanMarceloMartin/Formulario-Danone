## Freelance Project: Form (still in progress)

This project consists on a form that will be used for user's registration to an application.

The application requires information of the user's business, so apart from basic information like name, lastname or contact data, the user will enter:

* Address information using a Google Suggestion input.
* Tax Id number, for which an API will run a validation.
* Images of the clients facilities and equipment.

Once a day this form will gather the information of the registrations created during the last 24 hours, will convert it to excel format and send it via email.

### `Steps to go before finish`

* Everything is functional except for the mail sending feature.
* FinalsStyle is yet to be determined and implemented.
* Front-end validation of fields like phone number, id number and e-mail are yet to be implemented.
* Modularization of file inputs and regular inputs is yet to be implemented.

### `Future Idea for this project's code`

Once this project is finished, this code will be used as a baseground to develop a Form Builder.
